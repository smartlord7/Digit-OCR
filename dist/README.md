### Set up
1. Extract this .zip into a known location.
2. Retrieve these files from Google Drive:
  - train_seq_input.zip - this .zip contains the outputs generated by the filter
 which were used to train the classifier within the Filter + Classifier OCR architecture.

  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JaPwiFYQDh7pFe-rF6iWw120jiV2k1Zi/view?usp=sharing
  - nnets.zip - this .zip contains the trained neural networks for both Classifier and Filter + Classifier architectures.
This contemplates the trained filter nnets - filter - and the trained classifier nnets (for when it is isolated - classifier - or working
together with the filter - classifier_seq).

### Project file structure - explanation
- src - contains all the source code used to train and test the system as well as the one that makes the UI.
- data - contains all the data outputted during the training and testing phase (nnets, nnets inputs).
- doc - contains the report as well as the the training results.

### GUI usage
1. Open Matlab R2022b.
2. Open the src folder contained in this .zip in the IDE.
3. Add all the folders contained in the src folder to the Matlab path (select them>right click>"Add to Path").
4. Go to the ui/ folder.
5. Open the file UI.mlapp.
6. Execute UI.mlapp.

- Test the OCR System
1. Choose an architecture in the NN Architecture dropdown.
2. Select the desired neural network(s) to use (use the ones contained in nnets.zip).
3. Click on the button "Test".

- Retrain the OCR System (with the same nnets configuration but different inputs)
1. Choose an architecture in the NN Architecture dropdown.
2. Select the desired neural network(s) to use (use the ones contained in nnets.zip).
3. Click on the button "Retrain".
4. Select an input file (i.e. the ones provided in the data/train_input or data/test_input).
5. Wait for the train to finish.
